## üìç Overview

Pulpo is a comprehensive Life Cycle Optimization (LCO) tool designed to streamline the optimization of environmental impacts across the entire lifecycle of products. It facilitates the import of data from the LCI databases accessed via brightway, converts inputs into optimization-ready formats, defines and solves optimization models using the Pyomo package, and saves and summarizes results. Pulpo empowers users to efficiently optimize and analyze environmental impacts, supporting sustainable decision-making through lifecycle-based strategies.

| [pulpo.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\pulpo.py)                                   | The code implements a PulpoOptimizer class that provides functionalities for data import, optimization, solving, retrieval, saving and summarizing results related to life cycle assessments. It uses modules like optimizer, bw_parser, converter, and saver for different operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [bw_parser.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\bw_parser.py)                     | The code in `bw_parser.py` provides functions for importing, saving, and retrieving life cycle inventory (LCI) data from the Ecoinvent database using the Brightway2 library. It includes functions for importing data, checking if data needs to be reloaded, performing LCA calculations, saving LCI data to files, and reading LCI data from files. Additionally, it provides functions for retrieving activities and environmental flows from the database based on specified criteria. |
| [converter.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\converter.py)                     | The code in pulpo\utils\converter.py combines various inputs into a dictionary for an optimization model. It converts sparse matrices to dictionaries, modifies the technosphere matrix, creates sets, specifies demand, limits, and supply, assigns weights, and assembles the final data dictionary for the model. This function serves as a crucial step in preparing the inputs for the optimization process.                                                                                                                                         |
| [optimizer.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\optimizer.py)                     | The code defines an optimization model using the pyomo package. It includes sets, parameters, variables, constraints, and an objective function.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation
PULPO has been deployed to the pypi index and can now be installed via:
```sh
pip install pulpo-dev
```


### ü§ñ Running pulpo
See [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pulpo-dev/) for a description of how to use PULPO via pip.

Find example notebooks for a [hydrogen case](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/master/notebooks/hydrogen_showcase.ipynb), an [electricity case](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/master/notebooks/electricity_showcase.ipynb), and a [plastic case](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/master/notebooks/plastic_showcase.ipynb) here.

### üß™ Tests

Calling from the package folder: 

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### Updates 
> **03.09.2024**
>
> **PULPO** now includes functions to generate the rice husk example database from the TCM paper by [K√§telh√∂n et al. (2016)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b04270). Additionally, you can create a **generic LCI database** with user-defined characteristics for feature testing purposes:
>
> **Functions:**
> - `install_rice_husk_db()`: Sets up the rice husk example database.
> - `install_generic_db()`: Configures a generic LCI database in Brightway2 with parameters such as number of products, processes, regions, and more.
>
> **Example Usage:**
> ```python
> import pulpo
>
> # Install a generic LCI database with custom parameters
> project = "my_custom_project"
> database = "my_custom_db"
> n_prod = 10   # Number of products
> n_proc = 5    # Max number of processes per product
> n_reg = 4     # Number of regions
> n_inputs = 6  # Max number of inputs per process
> n_flows = 8   # Number of environmental flows
> n_methods = 3 # Number of impact assessment methods
> seed = 42     # Seed for reproducibility
>
> pulpo.install_generic_db(project=project, database=database, n_prod=n_prod, n_proc=n_proc, 
>                          n_reg=n_reg, n_inputs=n_inputs, n_flows=n_flows, n_methods=n_methods, seed=seed)
>  ```
> A workshop demonstrating the use of PULPO with these two non-commercial/testing databases will be presented at Brightcon 2024 in Hamburg (23.09-27.09.2024). Once the workshop is concluded, the corresponding notebooks will be made available and linked here.

```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
