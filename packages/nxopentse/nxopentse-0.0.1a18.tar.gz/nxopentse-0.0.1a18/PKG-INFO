This package contains functions which you can use in your own scripts, so you don't have to write everything from scratch.
```
pip install nxopentse
```

> **NOTE:** You need to have configured NX/Simcenter to work with the external python interpreter.
> 

Then in your script add 
``` 
import nxopentse
``` 

Simple example:
```
import NXOpen
import nxopentse as tse


# Every NXOpen journal needs an NXOpen.Session object
the_session: NXOpen.Session = NXOpen.Session.GetSession()


def main():
    tse.cad.nx_hello()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```



## nxopen.cad
CAD functionality


## nxopan.cae
CAE functionality


## nxopen.tools
General tools which can be used in different NX applications.
