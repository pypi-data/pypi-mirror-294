-----
Validate and impute your dataset with mathematical expressions.

Symbolic Constraints, or `symconstraints` for short, allows you to express your dataset rules
using mathematical equations and expressions. It makes use of the powerful [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) Computer Algebra System to analyze
mathematical expressions and infer all possible validation and imputation methods to your datasets.

## Installation

Symbolic constraints can be installed via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```console
pip install symconstraints
```

## Features

### ðŸª„ Automatic inference

`symconstraints` uses SymPy to rearrange your formulas and find new ways to validate and impute your data.

### Example

Given the constraints $a < 3b$ and $c > b^2 + 1$:

```python
>>> from symconstraints import Constraints, symbols
>>> a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
>>> constraints = Constraints([a < 3*b, c > b**2 + 1])
>>> for validation in constraints.validations
...     print(validation)
Validation: (b, a) => [a < 3*b] inferred by (a < 3*b)
Validation: (b, c) => [c > b**2 + 1] inferred by (c > b**2 + 1)
Validation: (a, c) => [a/3 < sqrt(c - 1)] inferred by (c > b**2 + 1, a < 3*b)
```

It automatically infers that $\frac{a}{3} < \sqrt{c-1}$.

### ðŸ§© Integrations

Integrates with popular data science tools such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Saving you time to help you clean your datasets with little code.

_scikit-learn and Pandera integrations are currently under development._

### Example

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from symconstraints import Constraints
>>> from symconstraints.pandas import symbols, check, set_invalid_all, impute
>>> from sympy import Eq
>>> df = pd.DataFrame(
...    {
...         "height": [5, 6, 8, 9],
...         "width": [3, 5, 7, None],
...         "area": [14, 30, None, 18],
...     },
...     dtype=float,
... )
>>> height, width, area = symbols(df, ["height", "width", "area"])
>>> constraints = Constraints([height > width, Eq(area, width * height)])
>>> check_result = check(constraints, df)
>>> df = set_invalid_all(check_result, df)
>>> df
    height  width  area
0     NaN    NaN   NaN
1     6.0    5.0  30.0
2     8.0    7.0   NaN
3     9.0    NaN  18.0
>>> imputed_df = impute(constraints, df)
>>> imputed_df
    height  width  area
0     NaN    NaN   NaN
1     6.0    5.0  30.0
2     8.0    7.0  56.0
3     9.0    2.0  18.0
```
