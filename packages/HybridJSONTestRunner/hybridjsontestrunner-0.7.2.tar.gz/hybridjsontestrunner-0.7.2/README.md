# Hybrid JSON Test Runner

> A replacement for Gradescope's autograder-utils package


### Why?

Gradescope's autograder-utils package has been largely unmaintained since 2022, which is problematic as many features
have been added to the autograder platform since then. AND there exists well know breaking bugs with their implementation

This pacakge aims to address those concerns by support the most recent iteration of the autograder (last update 10-2-23)
while also adding support for other platforms (Like PrairieLearn) that also use similar JSON output formats.
