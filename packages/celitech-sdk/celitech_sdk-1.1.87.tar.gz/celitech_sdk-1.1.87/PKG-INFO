## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install celitech-sdk
```

## Environment Variables

These are the environment variables for the SDK:

| Name          | Description             |
| :------------ | :---------------------- |
| CLIENT_ID     | Client ID parameter     |
| CLIENT_SECRET | Client Secret parameter |

Environment variables are a way to configure your application outside the code. You can set these environment variables on the command line or use your project's existing tooling for managing environment variables.

If you are using a `.env` file, a template with the variable names is provided in the `.env.example` file located in the same directory as this README.

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from celitech import Celitech

sdk = Celitech(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from celitech import Celitech, Environment

sdk = Celitech(
    client_id="client-id",
    client_secret="client-secret",
    base_url=Environment.DEFAULT.value
)

result = sdk.destinations.list_destinations()

print(result)

```
