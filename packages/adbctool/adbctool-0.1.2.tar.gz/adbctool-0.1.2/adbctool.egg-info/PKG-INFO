## Gen Vehicle Protocol Tool
`adbctool` is a convinent tool to let you quickly generate a nearly complete code for a new vehicle for [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo).

You only have to do is to have the dbc file (which is a communication protocol for the car, which is usually made by the vehicle integrated company), and write a less 10 lines config for generate an encode/decode.

## How to get vehicle's DBC file
- [opendbc](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc) is a project that opens the vehicle dbc protocol.
- [openvehicles](https://docs.openvehicles.com/en/latest/index.html) is an open car project that contains any vehicle information you want to know.
