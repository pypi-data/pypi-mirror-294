# GeneMaster Package [DEMO] 

## Description
The GeneMaster project is a comprehensive bioinformatics package designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of genetic sequences, including DNA and RNA. It provides a robust set of data types and operations tailored to genomic research, allowing users to perform tasks such as reverse complement generation, GC content calculation, RNA transcription, and protein translation. Additionally, it includes advanced algorithms for solving problems like the shortest superstring, longest common subsequence, and motif finding. The package also supports parsing FASTA format files and includes thorough testing modules to ensure accuracy and reliability in genetic sequence analysis.
