GemPy Probability
*****************

Overview
--------

``GemPy Probability`` is a package that extends the functionality of the
`GemPy <https://www.gempy.org>`_ package to include uncertainty quantification
and stochastic geological modeling. It is based on the `Pyro <https://pyro.ai>`_
probabilistic programming framework and allows for the integration of
probabilistic models into the geological modeling workflow.

(better option), or `read the docs <http://gempy.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Stochastic geological modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the most advanced features that sets ``GemPy`` also apart from
available commercial packages is the full integration of stochastic
geological modeling methods.
``GemPy`` was designed from the ground up to support stochastic geological
modeling for uncertainty analysis (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian
inference). This was achieved by writing ``GemPy``'s core architecture
using the numerical computation library `aesara <http://deeplearning.net/software/aesara/>`_
to couple it with the probabilistic programming
framework `PyMC3 <https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/getting_started.html>`_.
This enables the use of advanced sampling methods (e.g. Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo) and is of particular relevance when considering uncertainties in
the model input data and making use of additional secondary information
in a Bayesian inference framework.

We can, for example, include uncertainties with respect to the z-position
of layer boundaries in the model space. Simple Monte Carlo simulation
via PyMC will then result in different model realizations.

Pytorch allows the automated computation of gradients, opening the door to
the use of advanced gradient-based sampling methods
coupling ``GemPy`` and
`Pyro <https://pyro.ai>`_ (see `Pyro's documentation <http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_ii.html>`_
for advanced stochastic modeling. Also, the use of aesara allows making
use of GPUs through cuda (see the aesara documentation for more information.
