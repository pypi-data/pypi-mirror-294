Example of Inference

   Prior (in blue) and posterior distributions (in red) of all the parameters of the probabilistic model :math:`\theta` (the full list of values of the simulation can be found in Appendix X). Case A) correspond to the subtraction equation while Case B) has been generated with the summation equation. Both cases yield the exact same posterior for the random variables---within the Monte Carlo error---as expected.

Correlations

Furthermore, keep in mind that the inference happens in a multidimensional manifold---although for obvious visualization reasons we display each parameter independently. This means that although in the previous figures the posterior distributions seem independent, a closer examination---e.g. joint plots---uncovers correlation in the parameters.

   Correlations between parameters can be uncovered with joint plots.
