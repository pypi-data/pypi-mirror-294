:description: Faster prototyping with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) python views and HTML templates for your django models.

CRUD for your model
===================

Accelerate prototyping with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) python views and HTML templates, enhanced with htmx and Tailwind CSS.

CRUD
----

.. cappa:: falco.commands.ModelCRUD

.. warning::

    To avoid potential issues, particularly with the admin code generation, it is advised to run the ``install-crud-utils``
    command before using the ``crud`` command. If you've initialized your project using the ``start-project`` command,
    you don't need to run this as it is executed for you during project setup.

This command generates htmx-powered create, read, update, and delete views for your model. It follows a similar idea
as `neapolitan <https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan>`_, but with a completely different approach. Instead of inheriting
from a class as you would with ``neapolitan``, this command generates basic ``views``, ``urls``, ``forms``, ``admin`` (thanks to `django-extensions <https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin_generator.html>`_)
and HTML ``templates``, and updates or overrides the corresponding files in your project. I prefer this approach because, at the end, you'll have all the new code directly in front of you. It's easily
accessible and you can update it as you see fit. The idea is to accelerate project prototyping. Write a model and you instantly have views ready for it.


.. admonition:: Why function based views?
    :class: hint dropdown

    I think class-based views get complex faster than function-based views. Both have their use cases, but function-based views
    stay simpler to manage longer in my experience. There is an excellent document on the topic, read `django views the right way <https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/>`_.

.. If you want to see an example of the generated code, check out the `source code of the demo project <https://github.com/Tobi-De/falco/tree/main/demo/myjourney/entries>`_.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some options that you may want to set each time you generate ``CRUD`` views for a model. For instance, most of your views might require user
login, or you might have a specific set of HTML templates that you use every time you run the command. Typing the same options repeatedly can be tedious.
For such scenarios, some of the CLI options can be configured via the ``pyproject.toml`` file.

Here is an example illustrating all available configurations:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: ``pyproject.toml``

        .. code-block:: toml

            [tool.falco.crud]
            utils-path = "apps_dir/core"
            blueprints = "blueprints"
            login-required = true
            skip-git-check = true
            always-migrate = true

        .. note::

            All options are optional.

    .. tab:: description

        .. admonition:: Keys description
            :class: note

            **utils-path**: This will be written by the ``install-crud-utils`` command. Unless you are changing where the utils are installed, you don't need to worry about this.

            **blueprints**: If you are using custom blueprints for your ``html``, set the path here. It works exactly the same as the equivalent CLI option.

            **login-required**: Always generate views that are decorated with the ``login_required`` decorator.

            **skip-git-check**: (Not recommended) This option is for those who like to live dangerously. It will always skip the git check.

            **always-migrate**: This option can only be set in the ``pyproject.toml`` file. My current workflow is to create a new app, add fields to a model and then run ``crud``.
            I often forget to ``makemigrations`` and ``migrate``. This can cause the ``admin`` generation code to fail. With this option set, the ``crud`` command will first try to
            run ``makemigrations`` and ``migrate``. If either of these operations fails, the command will stop and print the error.




Python code
^^^^^^^^^^^

All Python code added by this command will be in **append** mode, meaning it won't override the content of your existing files.
Instead, it will add code at the end or create the files if they are missing. The files that will be modified
are ``forms.py``, ``urls.py``, ``admin.py`` (if you have `django-extension <https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ installed),
``views.py`` and your project root ``urls.py``.

For the sake brevity, I'll only show an example of what the ``urls.py`` file might look like for a model named ``Entry`` in a django app named ``entries``.

.. code-block::bash

    falco crud entry.entries

.. literalinclude:: /_static/snippets/urls.py

As you can see, the convention is quite simple: ``<model_name_lower>_<operation>``. Note that if you don't specify the model name and run
``falco crud entries``, the same code with the described conventions will be generated for all the models in the ``entries`` app.

Now, if you're anything like me, the code above might have made you cringe due to the excessive repetitions of the word ``entry``.
This wouldn't have been the case if the model was called ``Category``, for example. For these specific cases, there is an ``--entry-point`` option.

Let's try it.

.. code-block:: bash

    falco crud entries.entry --entry-point

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: entries/urls.py

    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    app_name = "entries"

    urlpatterns = [
        path("", views.index, name="index"),
        path("create/", views.create, name="create"),
        path("<int:pk>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
        path("<int:pk>/update/", views.update, name="update"),
        path("<int:pk>/delete/", views.delete, name="delete"),
    ]

Much cleaner, specifying that option means you consider the ``Entry`` model as the entry point of your ``entries`` app.
So, instead of the base URL of the app looking like ``entries/entries/``, it will just be ``entries/``.

As previously mentioned, the command will also register your app in your project root URLs configuration. This occurs when
you generate ``crud`` views for a model and there is no existing ``urls.py`` file for the app. In such cases, it is assumed
that you haven't already registered the URLs for your app since the command just created the file.

Here is an example of how the ``entries`` app will be registered.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: config/urls.py
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    ...
    path("entries/", include("entries.urls", namespace="entries"))
    ]



HTML templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike the Python code, the generated HTML templates will overwrite any existing ones. If you want to avoid this, you should commit
your changes before running this command or use the ``--only-python`` option to generate only Python code. The files are generated
with minimal styling (using Tailwind CSS) and are reasonably presentable.
Four files are generated:

* ``<model_name_lower>_list.html``
* ``<model_name_lower>_create.html``
* ``<model_name_lower>_detail.html``
* ``<model_name_lower>_update.html``

There is no ``<model_name_lower>_delete.html`` file because deletion is handled in the ``<model_name_lower>_list.html``.
Each generated HTML file extends a ``base.html`` template. Therefore, make sure you have a top-level ``base.html`` file in
your templates directory.


.. note::

    If you use the ``--entry-point`` option, the files will be named ``index.html``, ``create.html``, ``detail.html``, and ``update.html``.

To determine where to place the generated files, we check the ``DIRS`` key in the ``TEMPLATES`` settings of your Django project.
If it is populated, we take the first value in the list and generate the template files in ``<templates_dir>/<app_label>``.
If it is not populated, we use the classic Django layout, which is ``<app_label>/templates/<app_label>``.

.. If you want an overview of what the templates look like, check out the `demo project <https://github.com/Tobi-De/falco/tree/main/demo/templates/entries>`_.

Custom Templates
****************

The ``crud`` command supports the ability to specify your own HTML templates using the ``--blueprints`` option.
This option only takes into account HTML files and will completely override the default templates. The HTML templates
use the `jinja2 <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/>`_ syntax. To see examples of what the templates look like,
check out the base templates `here <https://github.com/Tobi-De/falco/tree/main/src/falco/crud/html>`_.

Below is an example of the context each template will receive.


.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    from falco.commands.crud.model_crud import HtmlBlueprintContext
    from falco.commands.crud.model_crud import get_html_blueprint_context
    from falco.commands.crud.model_crud import DjangoModel
    from pprint import pprint

    dj_model = DjangoModel(
        name = "Entry",
        name_plural = "Entries",
        verbose_name = "Entry",
        verbose_name_plural = "Entries",
        has_file_field = False,
        has_editable_date_field = False,
        fields = {
            "name": {"verbose_name": "Name", "editable": True, "class_name": "CharField", "accessor": "{{entry.name}}"},
            "price": {"verbose_name": "Price", "editable": True, "class_name": "DecimalField", "accessor": "{{entry.price}}"},
        }
    )

    pprint(get_html_blueprint_context(app_label="entries", django_model=dj_model), sort_dicts=False, compact=True, width=120)


Examples
^^^^^^^^

Some usage examples.

.. code:: bash

    $ falco crud entries.entry
    $ falco crud entries
    $ falco crud entries.entry -e="secret_field1" -e="secret_field2"
    $ falco crud entries.entry --only-html
    $ falco crud entries.entry --only-python
    $ falco crud entries.entry --entry-point
    $ falco crud entries.entry --entry-point --login
    $ falco crud entries.entry --blueprints /path/to/blueprints


install-crud-utils
------------------

.. cappa:: falco.commands.InstallCrudUtils

These utilities may be imported by some parts of the code generated by the ``crud`` command. They are not installed simultaneously
with the ``crud`` command because you only need to run this once. Running this for each execution of the ``crud`` command would not
make sense. However, you can run this to update your code if the utilities have changed in **falco**. Like all ``crud`` related Python code,
the code is written in append mode, meaning it always adds to the end of the file if it already exists, and creates it if not.

**Determining the Destination for the File**

The command accepts an optional ``output_dir`` argument. If not supplied, the command defaults to using the current directory's name, assuming a
subdirectory with an identical name exists. It considers this subdirectory as your apps directory and installs the utils in a ``core`` package within it.
For example, if your django project root directory is named ``my_project``, the command will assume that there's a ``my_project`` subdirectory within the
current ``my_project`` directory. This is the default layout for projects generated by the `start-project </the_cli/start_project>`_ command.
The utilities will be installed in ``my_project/my_project/core``. The command also add the `output_dir` path to your ``pyproject.toml`` to
be able to reinstall at the same exact path without you having to retype the output for the next times.
The command also records the ``output_dir`` path in your ``pyproject.toml``, enabling you to reinstall the utilities at the exact same location
in future runs without needing to re-enter the output path.

If you decide to use the ``output`` argument to change the file's destination path (which defaults to ``core/utils.py``), you may need to adjust
some imports after executing the ``crud`` command.

.. note::

    If you're using the default Django project structure, it's likely that your apps are located in the root directory of your project.
    In this case, you can run the command ``falco install-crud-utils core`` to install the utils in a ``core`` package in the current directory.


Here is an example of the output of the ``install-crud-utils`` command.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: utils.py

        .. literalinclude:: /_static/snippets/utils.py

    .. tab:: types.py

        .. literalinclude:: /_static/snippets/types.py
