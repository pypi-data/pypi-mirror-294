    Apply a constant amount of gain to match a specific loudness (in LUFS). This is an
    implementation of ITU-R BS.1770-4.

    For an explanation on LUFS, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUFS

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_normalization

    Warning: This transform can return samples outside the [-1, 1] range, which may lead to
    clipping or wrap distortion, depending on what you do with the audio in a later stage.
