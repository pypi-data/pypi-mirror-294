# Brukertools 

i2nca features tools that access the Bruker propietary formats for MSI data (.tsf and .tdf). These need the additional TDF-SKD distributed by Bruker.
To install these tools, follow these steps:
1) Get the TDF-SKD from Bruker (distributed for free at [Bruker](https://www.bruker.com/en/services/software-downloads.html))
2) Install i2nca into a virtual env (like a conda env)
3) Copy the files timsdata.dll and timsdata.lib from the TDF-SDK and place them at the level of the python executable of the env.
4) Reinstall i2nca into the env with the following command
```
pip uninstall i2nca
pip install i2nca@git+https://github.com/cKNUSPeR/i2nca.git@brukertools
```
