`icflow` is a Python package with some prototype 'workflow' tools for use in ICHEC.

It is intended to help standardize some of our workflows in areas like Machine Learning by using common utilities, data-formats and data-structures. 

# Installation #

It is available on PyPI:

``` shell
pip install icflow
```
