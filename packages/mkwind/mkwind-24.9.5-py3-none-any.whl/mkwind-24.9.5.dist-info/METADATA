# What is mkwind?

mkwind is an accompanying package to mkite for running tasks on client workers.
This package allows running simulations without installing all the database requirements, thus protecting the server from modifications on the client side.
mkwind offers a set of tools for building, running, and postprocessing the tasks, and sending them back to mkite through `mkite_engines`.
