Note: All endpoints require basic authentication. Add -u username:password to your curl commands or use appropriate authentication in your HTTP client.

## Configuration:

The API can be configured using a folder_manager_api.config file. If not present, a default configuration will be created.

Sample configuration file (folder_manager_api.config):

```
[server]
port = 8000

[auth]
username = admin
password = password

[logging]
log_size = 1073741824
```

### Configuration details:

1. server section:
    - port: The port number on which the API server will run. Default is 8000.
2. auth section:
    - username: The username for basic authentication.
    - password: The password for basic authentication.
3. logging section:
    - log_size: Maximum size of the log file in bytes before it rotates. Default is 1073741824 (1GB).

You can modify these values to customize the API's behavior. If the configuration file is not present when the API starts, it will create a default one with these values.

## Logging:

The API logs all requests and responses to a file named folder_manager_api.log. The log file uses a rotating file handler, which means it will create new log files and archive old ones when the file size limit (specified in log_size) is reached.
