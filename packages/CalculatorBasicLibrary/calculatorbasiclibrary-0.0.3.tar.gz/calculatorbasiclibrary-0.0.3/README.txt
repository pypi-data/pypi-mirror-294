This is a library that is accosiated with numbers. This makes calculating in Python easier.
Te dSeq function creates and returns the Doubling Sequence up to the number given.
The sqrt function is Square Root.
The area function takes in 2 shapes. Rectangle, Triangle. Square, Parralelogram and Rhombus fall into the Rectangle catagory. The shape name should be lowercase.
The oddEven function takes 2 numbers and calculates how many odd and even numbers are in the range of the numbers with increment of 1.
The OEinc function does the same, but takes a third number as an increment.
e is Euler's number.
Here is an example to use the Calculator class.

print(Calculator.calculate("express"))

where calc is a variable and express is the expression (BIDMAS is accepted in the expression). The expression MUST BE in strings.
I hope you use this library and it helps you.
