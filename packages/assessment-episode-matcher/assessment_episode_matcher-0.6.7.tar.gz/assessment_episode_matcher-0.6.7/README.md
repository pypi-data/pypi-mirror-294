# TESTING

- First time online : `pip install -e .`
- from the root of project folder: `pytest tests/*.py`

# IMPORTANT  TODO 12/7/2024
Have to look at previous Episodes (for a whole year prior to start of reporting quarter) to correctly generate.
So the query to Match/ and surveytxt/ had do this.. and finally i had to remove COMS surveys and keep only current quarter.
