## Typing stubs for Jetson.GPIO

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`Jetson.GPIO`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`Jetson.GPIO`.

This version of `types-Jetson.GPIO` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `Jetson.GPIO==2.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Jetson.GPIO. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`4101e742366e5e1f79168fba8d97503b047dfd5b`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/4101e742366e5e1f79168fba8d97503b047dfd5b) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.378, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
