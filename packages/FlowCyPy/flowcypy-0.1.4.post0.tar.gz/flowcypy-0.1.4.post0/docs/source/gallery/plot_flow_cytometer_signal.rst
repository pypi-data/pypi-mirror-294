Simulating Flow Cytometer Signals
==================================

This example demonstrates how to simulate signals from a flow cytometer using
the `FlowCytometer` class.

Flow cytometers generate signals (e.g., forward scatter and side scatter) when
particles pass through a laser beam. These signals can be analyzed to obtain
information about the size, complexity, and other properties of the particles.

The above plot shows simulated raw signals for both Forward Scatter (FSC) and
Side Scatter (SSC) channels. The signals include realistic features such as
noise, baseline shifts, and saturation effects.

These signals can be used as a basis for developing and testing signal
processing algorithms in flow cytometry.
