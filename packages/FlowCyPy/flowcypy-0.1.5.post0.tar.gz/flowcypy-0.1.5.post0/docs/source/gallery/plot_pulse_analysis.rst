Analyzing Flow Cytometer Pulses
===============================

This example demonstrates how to analyze the pulses generated by a flow cytometer
using the `PulseAnalyzer` class.

Pulses in flow cytometry represent individual particles passing through a laser
beam. By analyzing these pulses, we can extract features such as peak height,
width, and area, which provide information about the properties of the particles.

    # Import the necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    from FlowCyPy import PulseAnalyzer

    # Create a synthetic signal with two Gaussian pulses
    time = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
    signal = np.exp(-((time - 3) ** 2) / (2 * 0.1 ** 2)) + np.exp(-((time - 7) ** 2) / (2 * 0.1 ** 2))

    # Create a PulseAnalyzer instance
    analyzer = PulseAnalyzer(time=time, signal=signal, height_threshold=0.5)

The above output shows the heights, widths, and areas of the detected pulses.

These features are useful for characterizing particles in flow cytometry.
For example, the peak height might correspond to the intensity of scattered
light, while the width could indicate the time it takes for a particle to pass
through the laser beam.
