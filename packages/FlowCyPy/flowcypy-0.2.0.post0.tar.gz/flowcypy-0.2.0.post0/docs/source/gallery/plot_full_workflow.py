Simulating and Analyzing Flow Cytometer Signals
===============================================

This script demonstrates how to simulate flow cytometer signals using the `FlowCytometer` class
and analyze the results using the `PulseAnalyzer` class from the `FlowCyPy` library.

Flow cytometers measure forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) signals when particles pass through a laser beam,
providing information about particle size, complexity, and other characteristics.

Steps in this Workflow:
-----------------------
1. Define a particle size distribution using `ScattererDistribution`.
2. Simulate flow cytometer signals using `FlowCytometer`.
3. Analyze the forward scatter signal with `PulseAnalyzer` to extract features like peak height, width, and area.
4. Visualize the generated signals and display the extracted pulse features.

# Step 1: Import necessary modules from FlowCyPy
from FlowCyPy import FlowCytometer, ScattererDistribution, PulseAnalyzer, Detector, Source, Flow

# Example usage of the Flow class
flow = Flow(
    flow_speed=80e-6,  # 80 micrometers per second
    flow_area=1e-6,  # 1 square micrometer
    total_time=1.0,  # 1 second of flow
    mean_flow_rate=1e-6,  # 1 micrometer per second
    std_flow_rate=0.2e-6,  # 0.2 micrometers per second standard deviation
    scatterer_density=1e12  # 1e12 particles per cubic meter
)

# Step 2: Define the particle size distribution
# ---------------------------------------------
# Using a normal size distribution with a mean of 10 µm and a standard deviation of 0.8 µm.
# This defines the scatterers (particles) that will interact with the laser source.
scatterer_distribution = ScattererDistribution(
    flow=flow,
    refractive_index=1.5,        # Refractive index of the particles
    mean_size=10e-6,             # Mean particle size: 10 µm
    std_size=8e-7,               # Standard deviation: 0.8 µm
    distribution_type='normal'   # Normal distribution
)

# Step 3: Define the light source
# -------------------------------
# Define a laser source that illuminates the particles. The wavelength and power of the laser are crucial
# for determining how the particles scatter light (e.g., Rayleigh scattering is wavelength-dependent).
source = Source(
    numerical_aperture=0.4,      # Numerical aperture of the focusing optics
    wavelength=1550e-9,          # Wavelength of the laser source: 1550 nm
    optical_power=200e-3,        # Optical power of the laser source: 200 milliwatt
)

# Step 4: Define the detector
# ---------------------------
# A detector is used to measure the scattered light. The detector's numerical aperture and responsitivity
# affect how much light it collects and converts to an electrical signal.
detector = Detector(
    theta_angle=0,               # Angle of the detector relative to the incident light beam
    numerical_aperture=0.4,      # Numerical aperture of the detector optics
    name='first detector',       # Name or identifier for this detector
    responsitivity=1,            # Responsitivity of the detector (efficiency of detecting scattered light)
    acquisition_frequency=1e4,   # Sampling frequency: 10,000 Hz
    noise_level=1e-2,            # Signal noise level: 1 millivolt
    baseline_shift=0.01,         # Baseline shift of the detector output
    saturation_level=1e30,       # Saturation level of the detector signal
    n_bins=1024                  # Discretization bins for digitizing the signal
)

# Step 5: Simulate Flow Cytometer Signals
# ---------------------------------------
# Create a FlowCytometer instance to simulate forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) signals.
# The source, particle size distribution, and detector are passed in as parameters.
cytometer = FlowCytometer(
    coupling_mechanism='rayleigh',    # Use Rayleigh scattering for small particles
    source=source,                    # Laser source defined above
    scatterer_distribution=scatterer_distribution,  # Particle size distribution defined above
    detectors=[detector]              # List of detectors used in the simulation (only one here)
)

# Simulate the pulse signals generated as particles pass through the laser beam.
cytometer.simulate_pulse()

# Display the properties of the simulated cytometer, including laser power, flow speed, etc.
cytometer.print_properties()

# Visualize the simulated signals for FSC/SSC channels.
cytometer.plot()

# Step 6: Analyze the Simulated FSC Signal
# ----------------------------------------
# Create a PulseAnalyzer instance to analyze the forward scatter (FSC) signal from the detector.
# The analysis extracts features such as peak height, width, and area from the FSC signal.
analyzer = PulseAnalyzer(
    detector=detector,            # Analyze the signal from the defined detector
    height_threshold=None         # Threshold for detecting peaks (None means auto-detect)
)

# Run the analysis to detect and measure pulse features.
analyzer.run()

# Visualize the detected peaks in the signal.
analyzer.plot()

# Display the extracted peak features such as height, width, and area.
analyzer.display_features()
