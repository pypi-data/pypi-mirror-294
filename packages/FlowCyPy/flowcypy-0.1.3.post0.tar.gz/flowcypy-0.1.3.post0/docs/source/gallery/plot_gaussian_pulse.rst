Plotting a Gaussian Pulse
==========================

This example demonstrates how to create and visualize a Gaussian pulse using the
`GaussianPulse` class.

The Gaussian pulse is useful for modeling signals in various scientific applications,
such as simulating the response of a detector to a particle passing through a laser beam.

    # Import the necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    from FlowCyPy import GaussianPulse

    # Define the time axis in microseconds (μs)
    time = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)

    # Create a GaussianPulse instance
    pulse = GaussianPulse(center=0, height=1.0, width=1.0)

    # Generate and plot the pulse
    pulse.plot()

The above plot shows a Gaussian pulse centered at 0 μs with a peak amplitude
of 1.0 volts and a standard deviation (width) of 1.0 μs. The time axis is
given in microseconds.

You can adjust the parameters (center, height, width) to see how they affect
the shape and position of the pulse.
