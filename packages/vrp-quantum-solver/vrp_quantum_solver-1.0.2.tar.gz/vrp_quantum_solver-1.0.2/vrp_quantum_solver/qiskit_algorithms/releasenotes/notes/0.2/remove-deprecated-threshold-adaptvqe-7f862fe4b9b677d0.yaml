upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``threshold`` input argument of :class:`~.AdaptVQE` has been removed,
    and replaced by ``gradient_threshold``. This change was made to avoid confusion with
    the later introduced ``eigenvalue_threshold`` argument. The updated AdaptVQE use
    would look like this::

        from qiskit_algorithms import VQE, AdaptVQE

        adapt_vqe = AdaptVQE(
                      VQE(Estimator(), ansatz, optimizer),
                      gradient_threshold=1e-3,
                      eigenvalue_threshold=1e-3
                    )
