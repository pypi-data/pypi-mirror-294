class PatchGenericPickle:
    """A mixin that allows generic pydantic models to be serialized and deserialized with pickle.

    Notes
    ----
    In general, pickle shouldn't be encouraged as a means of serialization since there are better,
    safer options. In some cases e.g. Streamlit's `@st.cache_data there's no getting around
    needing to use pickle.

    As of Pydantic 2.7, generics don't properly work with pickle. The core issue is the following
    1. For each specialized generic, pydantic creates a new subclass at runtime. This class
       has a `__qualname__` that contains the type var argument e.g. `"MyGeneric[str]"` for a
       `class MyGeneric(BaseModel, Generic[T])`.
    2. Pickle attempts to find a symbol with the value of `__qualname__` in the module where the
       class was defined, which fails since Pydantic defines that class dynamically at runtime.
       Pydantic does attempt to register these dynamic classes but currently only for classes
       defined at the top-level of the interpreter.
