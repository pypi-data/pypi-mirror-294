# devstack

A tool for managing docker stacks.

It reads a yaml file in the docker-compose (for swarm) format and creates the following things:
- a stack name using the 'stem' part of the file (ex: omg.yml â†’ stack name = omg)
- create every external network defined in the file before starting the stack.
- deploy the stack using `docker stack deploy`

In the spirit of kubectl command, `devstack` command take a yaml file as argument.
