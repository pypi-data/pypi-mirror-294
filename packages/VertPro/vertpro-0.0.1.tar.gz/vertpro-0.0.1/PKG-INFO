This is a library that is supposed to help with conversion. More types of conversion will be added while this library goes through updates
Hope this helps.
Made by the same 11 year old who made CalculatorBasicLibrary.
This will be automatically downloaded with CBL(the short for CalculatorBasicLibrary) when it is complete.
NOTE: Money conversions will either not be added here or they will be changed only when an update for something else occurs..
