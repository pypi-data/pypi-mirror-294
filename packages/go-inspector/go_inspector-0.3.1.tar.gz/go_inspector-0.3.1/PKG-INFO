go-inspector
================================

go-inspector is a utility to extract dependencies and symbols from Go binaries.
It is designed to work as a ScanCode Toolkit plugin and integrated in ScanCode.io

To install and use:

- Run ``pip install go-inspector``
- Use with ``scancode --json-pp - --go-symbol --verbose <PATH to a tree or file with Go binaries>``

The JSON output will contain various dependencies and symbols found in Go binaries if any.

Development
----------------

- Install requirements and dependencies using ``make dev``
- Then ``source venv/bin/activate``

Testing:

- To run tests: ``pytest -vvs``
- To regen test fixtures: ``SCANCODE_REGEN_TEST_FIXTURES=yes pytest -vvs``
- To update the bundled GoReSym, see src/bin/update.sh


How to re-generate test binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are compiled (and committed) from code in tests/data/basic :

- Run ``go tool dist list`` to get all possible pairs of OSes and arches to compile the binary.
- Then build a OS/arch pair like this to get compiled binaries:
  ``GOOS=<OS> GOARCH=<arch> go build -o ./tests/data/basic/app_<OS>_exe ./tests/data/main.go``
- Make a copy and run strip of the Linux executable as "app_lin_exe_stripped"
