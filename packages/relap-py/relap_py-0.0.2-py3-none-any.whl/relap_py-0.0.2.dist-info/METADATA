# INSTALLATION:

    - install with pip install relap_py
    - modify the relapwin_loc and relap_exe variables to your environment


# TODO:
    - adapt to TRACE plotting (basically reading data from csv files)
    - Make steady state table
    - read and plot uncertainty bands
    - just perform data extraction and write to file

# CONFIGURATION AND DEFAULTS

relapwin_loc = 'C:/cygwin64/usr/local/bin'
relap_exe = 'relap5-33iy-win32-ifc-opt.exe'
