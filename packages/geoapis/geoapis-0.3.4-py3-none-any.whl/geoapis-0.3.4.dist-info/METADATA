# geoapis

![Linux](https://github.com/niwa/geoapis/actions/workflows/linux-test.yml/badge.svg)

**_geoapis_** is a Python package for simply downloading publicly available web-hosted geo-spatial data. It currently supports downloading LiDAR data from OpenTopography, and vector data from the LINZ Data Service.

## Installation
**_geoapis_** is avaliable on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geoapis) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geoapis/). Conda is recommended due to difficulties installing geopandas (a dependency) with pip on Windows. See the [Wiki Install Instructions](https://github.com/niwa/geoapis/wiki/Package-Install-Instructions) for more information.

## Documentation
Package API documentation is hosted at https://rosepearson.github.io/GeoFabrics/. Usage, installation and testing documentation can be found at the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/niwa/geoapis/wiki).

### Development
Please see the [issues](https://github.com/niwa/geoapis/issues) for details on coming features and additions to the software. Please also submit any requests for new functionality here.

### Contributions
