Release procedure
=================

This document is a checklist for creating a toot release.

Currently the process is pretty manual and would benefit from automatization.

Bump & tag version
------------------

* Update the version number in `setup.py`
* Update the version number in `toot/__init__.py`
* Update `changelog.yaml` with the release notes & date
* Run `make changelog` to generate a human readable changelog
* Commit the changes
* Run `./scripts/tag_version <version>` to tag a release in git
* Run `git push --follow-tags` to upload changes and tag to GitHub

Publishing to PyPI
------------------

* `make dist` to create source and wheel distributions
* `make publish` to push them to PyPI

GitHub release
--------------

* [Create a release](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot/releases/) for the newly
  pushed tag, paste changelog since last tag in the description
* Upload the assets generated in previous two steps to the release:
    * source dist (.zip and .tar.gz)
    * wheel distribution (.whl)

TODO: this can be automated: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/

Update documentation
--------------------

To regenerate HTML docs and deploy to toot.bezdomni.net:

```
make docs-deploy
```
