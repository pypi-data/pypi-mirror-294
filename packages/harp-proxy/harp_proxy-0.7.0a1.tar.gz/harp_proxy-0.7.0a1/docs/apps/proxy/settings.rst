    This should be completely autogenerated, for now it was made using ``pyreverse harp_apps.proxy.settings -o dot`` for
    inheritance, followed by a manual edition to add relations. We can use this base but then introspect pydantic models
    to make sure we have all the relations, amnual edit is error prone.
