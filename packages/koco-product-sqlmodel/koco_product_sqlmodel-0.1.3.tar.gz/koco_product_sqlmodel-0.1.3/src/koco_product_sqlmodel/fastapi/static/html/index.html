    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="test">This website contains the FastAPI-Implemention for the REST-API to the KOCO MOTION Catalog Database. It is the starting point for a much larger goal: the KOCO Supplier-Distributor-Link. This will offer the possibility connect suppliers and distributors and let them share detailed information on their products in a structured format.</p>
    <p>This API makes the first step to make the KOCO product database accessible from different tools. It will be used for a web-interface implementation that shall offer easy means to add, review, revise and publish data on products.</p>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>The vision of this project is to bring suppliers and distributors closer together, make them fast in updating product updates on both supplier and distributor channels. As suppliers have distributors all over the world the need for sharing information is huge. Today the data is shared in various ways but never nicely defined and structured. Using this data straight away for new publications is impossible. This project is going to change this...</p>
    <h2>API Documentation</h2>
    <p>The API-Documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and can be found in <a href="/docs">here</a></p>
