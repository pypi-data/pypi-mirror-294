# AIGYM

The goal of this libray is provide a set of tools to help you to learn the basics of Artificial Intelligence. In other words, the goal of this library is help you to learn how to build agents that solve problems by searching.

This library implements the following algorithms:

1. Breadth-first search 
1. Depth-first search 
1. Iterative deepening search 
1. Uniform cost search 
1. Greddy search algorithm
1. A* search algorithm 
1. Hill climbing search algorithm
1. Stocastic hill climbing search algorithm

This library also has a common interface for agents, allowing you to easily create and deploy agents that solve problems by searching.

## How to install the library

```bash
pip install aigyminsper
```
