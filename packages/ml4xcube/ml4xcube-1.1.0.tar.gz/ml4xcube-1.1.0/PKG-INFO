# ml4xcube: Machine Learning Toolkits for Data Cubes

Welcome to `ml4xcube`, a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed for researchers and developers in the field of machine learning with an emphasis on `xarray` data cubes. Our toolkit is engineered to provide specialized and robust support for data cube management and analysis, operating with the state-of-the-art machine learning libraries (1) `scikit-learn`, (2) `PyTorch` and (3) `TensorFlow`. 

## Installation

Get started with `ml4xcube` effortlessly by installing it directly through pip:
```bash
pip install ml4xcube
```
or Conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ml4xcube
```

Make sure you have Python version 3.8 or higher.

If you're planning to use `ml4xcube` with TensorFlow or PyTorch, set up these frameworks properly in your Conda environment. 

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization/standardization functions
- Gap filling features
- Dataset creation and train-/ test split sampling techniques
- Trainer classes for `sklearn`, `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch`
- Distributed training framework compatible with `PyTorch`
- chunk utilities for working with data cubes

## Usage

To use `ml4xcube` in your project, simply import the necessary module:

```python
from ml4xcube.preprocessing import normalize, standardize
from ml4xcube.training.pytorch import Trainer
# Other imports...
```

You can then call the functions directly:

```python
# Normalizing data
normalized_data = normalize(your_data, data_min, data_max)

# Trainer instance
trainer = Trainer(
    model           = reg_model,
    train_data      = train_loader,
    test_data       = test_loader,
    optimizer       = optimizer,
    best_model_path = best_model_path,
    early_stopping  = True,
    patience        = 3,
    epochs          = epochs
)

# Start training
reg_model = trainer.train()
```
