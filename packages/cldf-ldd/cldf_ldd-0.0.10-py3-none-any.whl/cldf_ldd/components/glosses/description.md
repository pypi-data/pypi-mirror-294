# Glosses
Glosses are either shorthand translations in the metalanguage or [glossing abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glossing_abbreviations).
In the context of language description, it is important to keep them distinct from the meanings, [inflectional values](../inflectionalvalues)   , or [derivational processes](../derivationalprocesses) they express.
