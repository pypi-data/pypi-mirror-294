# Stems
A stem is what [inflectional morphological processes](../inflections) are applied to to form a valid [wordform](../wordforms).
Inflectional morphology may not be needed for a valid form.
Stems can be [morphologically complex](../stemparts), being formed by processes like [derivation](../derivations) or composition (not yet modeled).

[Language_ID](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#languageReference) | `string` | A reference to a language (or variety) the stem belongs to
[Name](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#name) | `string` | <div>             <p>A title, name or label for an entity.</p>         </div>

`Parameter_ID` | list of `string` (separated by `; `) | A reference to the meaning denoted by the stem.

[Segments](http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#segments) | list of `string` (separated by ` `) | <div>             <p>                 A list of segments (aka a sound sequence) is understood as the strict segmental                 representation of a                 <a href="http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/FormUnit">form unit</a>                 of a language, which is usually given in phonetic transcription.                 <a href="http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/Suprasegmental">Suprasegmental elements</a>,                 like tone or accent, of sound sequences are                 usually represented in a sequential form, although they are usually                 co-articulated along with the segmental elements of a sound sequence.                 Alternatively, suprasegmental aspects could also be represented as part of the                 <a href="#prosodicStructure">prosodic structure</a> of a word form.             </p>         </div>
