# Stems
A stem is what [inflectional morphological processes](../inflections) are applied to to form a valid [wordform](../wordforms).
Inflectional morphology may not be needed for a valid form.
Stems can be [morphologically complex](../stemparts), being formed by processes like [derivation](../derivations) or composition (not yet modeled).
