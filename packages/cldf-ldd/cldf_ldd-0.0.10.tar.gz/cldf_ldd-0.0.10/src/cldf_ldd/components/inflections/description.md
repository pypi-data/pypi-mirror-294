# Inflection
Inflection refers to morphological processes with which wordforms express [grammatical categories](../inflectionalcategories) like person, tense, or gender.
Inflections are conceptualized as linking a [wordform](../wordforms) (via a [wordformpart](../wordformpart)) with the following entities: a [stem](../stems) (of which it is an inflected form), an [inflectional value](inflectionalvalues) (for which it is inflected).
The multivalued nature of `Wordformpart_ID` allows multiple inflectional values expressed in a single morph.
