## Usage

### CLI

You can interact with the CLI using `peneira`. For example, to search for papers on
_"artificial intelligence" and "syndromic surveillance"_ and save the results to a file, you can run:

```bash
peneira -s open_alex -s semantic_scholar --filename my-papers.json
```

You will be prompted to enter the search query for each source. The lib will search for papers in
OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar and store it in a file named `my-papers.json`.
If no filename is provided, the results will be stored to `results.json`.

You have also the option of export it to a bibtex file:

```bash
peneira -s open_alex -s semantic_scholar --format bibtex --filename my-papers.bib
```
