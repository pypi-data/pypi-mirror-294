# DRMaciver's Junk Drawer

This is a collection of utilities that I, DRMacIver, end up wanting in multiple projects
that don't really warrant their own stand-alone library (and that I don't want to maintain
as such).

Expect everything here to be pretty good and mostly stable but with absolutely zero
support guarantees. Honestly I'd recommend vendoring anything in here you actually want to use.
