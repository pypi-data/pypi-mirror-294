# metadata\_please

There are a couple of pretty decent ways to read metadata (`importlib-metadata`,
and `pkginfo`) but they tend to be pretty heavyweight.  This lib aims to do two
things, with as minimal dependencies as possible:

1. Support just enough metadata to be able to look up deps.
2. Do "the thing that pip does" when deciding what dist-info dir to look at.

# Version Compat

Usage of this library should work back to 3.7, but development (and mypy
compatibility) only on 3.10-3.12.  Linting requires 3.12 for full fidelity.
