class SelectionGame:
    """
    base class for an N-dimensional board game with K players
    each player makes a move by selecting a subset of the board positions of fixed size
        the motivation of this is a 'pick-place' game where the subset size is 2, such as chess or jenga
    this should be IMMUTABLE, all subclass methods like (make move, etc.) should return a copy of self with no shared info
    each observation is associated with
        a tuple of shape (D1,...,DN, *) boards (the * can be different for each board)
            i.e. ((D1,...,DN, *1),(D1,...,DN, *2),...)
            the * represents the shape of the underlying set
                we assume the underlying set is the product of a finite number of underlying sets. this makes
                    it easier to represent some games with potentially mixed input
        a shape (D1,...,DN, N) 'position' board that keeps track of each index's coordinates in each of the N dimensions
        a T dimensional vector with additional game information
    T and N are fixed, while Di can change (sequential data)

    Note that the game need not be deterministic, the only requirement is that the winning strategy is only dependent
        on the current state, as opposed to past values
    for example,
    chess would be represented with
        one shape (8,8) board, where each square contains an integer encoding the identity of the piece
            the integer must also encode relevant information like an unmoved king/rook (for castling), etc
        a shape (8,8,2) position board P where entry P[i,j] simply contains the vector (i,j)
        a T dimensional vector with information such as the current player, the time since last captured piece, etc.
    jenga would be represented with
        one shape (H,3,3,E) board and one shape (H,3,3) board,
            H is the tower height+1, E contains information about the piece,
            such as cartesian position, rotation
            the other board would have binary pieces represneting whether there is a piece in each square
        a shape (H,3,3,3) position board P where entry P[h,i,j] contains [h,i-1,j-1]
            (if we want the 'center' piece to be 0)
        a T dimensional vector with information such as the current player
