        implemented 5d chess
        tries to initalize like this:
            if initial_multiverse exists, uses this
            if intial_timeline exists, makes a multiverse with just this timeline
            if initial_board exists, makes a timeline with jsut this board
            otherwise, default board

        :param first_player: which player plays on the first board, default 0 (white)
        :param check_validity: whether to run validity check on each move; default false
        :param save_moves: whether to save moves (useful for undoing moves); default True

        NOTE:
            THE WAY TO TEST FOR CHECKMATE/STALEMATE SHOULD BE THE FOLLOWING:
                if the current player cannot advance the present with any set of moves, stalemate
                if the current player captures opponent king:
                    IF on the opponents last turn, there was a king in check:
                        checkmate
                    OTHERWISE:
                        IF on the opponents last turn, there was no possible sequence of moves to avoid this:
                            stalemate
                        OTHERWISE:
                            checkmate

            the reason we do this is because a 'stalemate test' is expensive
                we have to check all possible sequences of opponent moves
                thus, we do this check maybe once at the end of each game to help runtime

        """
        returns an iterable of all possible turns subsets of the specified player
            if player is None, uses the first player that needs to move

        this problem is equivalent to the following:
            consider the set of all possible moves, ignoring those that do not move to a currently active board
                (i.e. ignore any moves that always spawn a new timeline)
            break these into equivalence classes by their start/end dimensions
            DAG subgraphs in this graph where each vertex is the source of at most one edge are exactly equivalent to
                all subsets of moves that are possible. (we can additionally add back any of the ignored moves so that
                    each board is the source of at most one move)

            first, for any DAG subgraph of this type we can always do all of the moves
                    this is true since we can topologically sort them then do them from the bottom up
                    this works bc a move is impossible if the board it starts from has already been moved to
                    since we are going backwards through the DAG, each starting board cannot have been moved to
            additionally, we can add any subset of the ignored moves to this set of moves and have the same property
                    this is true since we can just do all the ignored moves first.
                        since no ignored move ends at a potential 'starting' board, this will not interfere with anything
            Thus, the moves corresponding to a DAG subgraph of the graph where each vertex is the source of one edge
                unioned with any of the ignored moves is a valid set of moves

            for the other direction, consider a valid set of moves. Since they are valid, they must have some order
                that allows them to be valid in the game
            This order corresponds to a topological sort of the edges in our constructed directed graph. This proves
                that the graph is a DAG since in the game, a board that is the end of a move cannot start a new move
                additionally, each vertex is the source of exactly one edge, as there is only one move per board

        NOTE: it is not true that the result of a set of moves are independent of the order
            if we spawn two new timelines, the order we did the moves determines the numbers of the timelines
            thus, order does matter for the result of the moves

        Thus, for this method, we eventually have to check all possible permutations of these edges

        NOTE: THIS IS ONLY NEEDED TO CALL ONCE PER GAME AS A STALEMATE CHECK,
            TO CHECK IF A CAPTURE OF A KING COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

            PLAYING THE GAME LIKE THIS WILL BE BETTER FOR RUNTIME
