Implementation of ["Cell2Sentence: Teaching Large Language Models the Language of Biology"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557287v3.full.pdf).
Cell2Sentence (C2S) is a framework for directly adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to single-cell biology. C2S proposes a rank-ordering transformation of cell 
expression into cell sentences, which are sentences of space-separated gene names ordered by descending expression. By representing single-cell data as cell 
sentences, C2S provides a framework for LLMs to directly model single-cell biology in natural language, enabling diverse capabilities on multiple single-cell
tasks.

## News

ðŸŽ‰ (09/03/2024) We release the new C2S code base, with core functionalities for working with C2S models in common single-cell workflows!

ðŸŽ‰ (09/03/2024) We release a new suite of Pythia models for cell type prediction, cell type conditioned generation, and a diverse multi-cell multi-task model! These models are trained on over 57 million human and mouse cells from CellxGene and Human Cell Atlas.

ðŸŽ‰ (05/01/2024) Cell2Sentence was accepted to ICML 2024! Congratulations to all of the authors involved in the project. See you in Vienna!

ðŸŽ‰ (02/15/2024) **pythia-160m-c2s** trained on full cell sentences is available on the Hugging Face hub [here](https://huggingface.co/vandijklab/pythia-160m-c2s)! This new model generates and predicts cell types from entire cells directly in text with the [Pythia-160 base model](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-160m).

ðŸŽ‰ (02/15/2024) Our **updated preprint** was posted on BioRxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557287v3). We introduce our latest results, including full cell sentence generation, combinatorial cell label prediction, abstract generation, and training on a large multi-tissue dataset of 36M cells.


## Installation

To set up a cell2sentence environment, first pull the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vandijklab/cell2sentence.git
```

Navigate a terminal into the root of the repository. Next, create an Anaconda environment using `python3` using [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) with:
```bash
conda create -n cell2sentence python=3.8
```

Next, activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate cell2sentence
```

Finally, run the setup:
```bash
make install
```

This will install the latest development environment of cell2sentence, along with other pacakge dependendies.

The C2S package will allow usage of the core functionalities of C2S, including inference using existing C2S models and finetuning your own C2S models on your own datasets.

If you would like to speed up inference, you can optionally install flash-attention, which speeds up inference times particularly for long sequences (e.g. for generating cells with more than a few hundred genes):
```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
Detailed instructions for installing flash-attention can be found in the official [installation instructions](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-features). To enable flash attention 2, see the example in tutorial notebook 5 (cell generation).

## Model Zoo

The following is a collection of C2S pretrained models which are released for open use. Each is available through Huggingface, and has different capabilities
and pretraining recipies. More details on each model are provided in their respective Huggingface cards, and tutorial notebooks for different C2S workflows
each explain which model they use.
