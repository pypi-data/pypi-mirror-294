    Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405045

    Comment on the implementation:
    The integers used here correspond to the bit strings in the publication
    as follows:
    i ~ γ_A,γ_B
    j ~ 0,γ_B
    k ~ ν_B
    m ~ 0,ν_B
    and therefore:
    i^j     ~ γ_A,0
    (i^j)^m ~ γ_A,ν_B
    i^m     ~ γ_A,(γ_B ⊕ ν_B)
    So the loop over k iterates over all possible ν_B. While equation (17)
    suggests another loop over μ_B, there is only one μ_B = (γ_B ⊕ ν_B) that
    fulfils the specified condition ν_B ⊕ μ_B = γ_B so another nested loop is
    not necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : np.ndarray
        Diagonal entries of a density matrix in the graph state basis.
        Two copies of this state will be used to perform the protocol.
    graph : Graph

        graph state basis. Must contain coloring information of the
        two-colorable graph state.
