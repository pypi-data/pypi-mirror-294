## :earth_asia: Introduction

`earthlib` is a python package featuring a global spectral library of reference spectra, and a set of software tools for satellite-based land cover mapping in Earth Engine.

The library contains several thousand unique spectral endmembers representing green vegetation, soil, non-photosynthetic vegetation, urban materials, and burned materials. The reflectance data cover the visible to the shortwave infrared wavelengths (400-2450 nm) at 10 nm band widths.

The software tools (1) resample these data to match the wavelengths of popular satellite and airborne earth observing sensors and (2) run [spectral mixture analysis](docs/introduction.md) in Google Earth Engine via the `earthengine` python package.

The goal is to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of change in global vegetation cover, as well as patterns of soil cover, burned area, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and impervious surfaces. With `earthlib`, you can do this using a wide variety of public satellite [data sources](docs/sources.md).


## :seedling: Installation

This library can be installed via `pip`.

```bash
pip install earthlib
```

You can also clone the source repository and install it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earth-chris/earthlib.git
cd earthlib
pip install -e .
```
