# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and follows the Sionna versioning:
`(sionna_major, sionna_minor, sionna_patch, fix)`.

The three first parts indicate the official supported version of
Sionna, and `fix` is used to indicate patch version
for our library.
