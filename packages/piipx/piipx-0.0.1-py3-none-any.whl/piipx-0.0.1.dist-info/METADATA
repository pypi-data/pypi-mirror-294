# piipx

This package name is reserved to publish a variant of pipx that helps to prevent installing unintended packages, similar to how [piip](https://pypi.org/project/PIIP/) works. If you would like to see piipx released, please open or comment in an issue at the [PIIP repository](https://github.com/TNO-S3/PIIP/issues) so we can prioritize its development.
