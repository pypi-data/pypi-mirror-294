# 9/2/24 Selenium set up correctly, a and b obs sites buttons working again
# 8/29/24 also programmatically install pytz and certifi this will be version 3.6.4 - not working on mine
# 8/28/24 testing to successfully import folium v3.6.3
# as of 8/23/24 this is the latest version (8/21/24) that's working w/o overlapping, but concerns about folium install
# 8/21A/24 change local radar queue function to avoid dead ends
# then had to install folium programmatically, correctly. ver 3.6.2
# ver 3.6.0 with maps for land sites, back buttons and stored user choices on page choose
# 8/21/24 Ver 3.6.0 brief delay message when random sites chosen & improved greeting message
# 8/20B/24 prevent display of back button on page choose when xs length > 0
# 8/20B/24 previous choices stored from page choose for reference and reuse
# 8/20A/24 now frame1 back button working for all products during initial set up
# 8/20/24 finish install back buttons & other small things - not working for all products
# 8/19A/24 back buttons installed up through reg sat choice
# 8/19/24 add back buttons - started to mess up on page_choose
# 8/18D eliminates delay before showing map of 3 random sites
# 8/18C will add map to show 3 random sites. 18D eliminates blank delay
# 8/18B all 3 working with map, flash before the map fixed - took out update idletasks
# 8/18A has first two stations working, often with a flash before map is displayed. 18B will work to get all 3
# 8/18/24 some a variables deleted (pg 138) will add new map and technique to bobs on 18A
# 8/17A/24 replace5nearby aobs check land working great. 17B will add color coding - giving up for now
# 8/17/24 replace5nearby layout set. Map not redrawn upon each site choice on 8/17A
# 8/12A/24 replace5nearby layout very close to goal. Buttons slow response
# 8/12/24 replace5nearby includes the new techniques for aobs_check_land
# 8/12/24 Have to change sounding functions back because of problems with 'img_label_sounding'
# 8/12/24 is 3.5.2 back to old error catching for radiosonde, calling next function or hide upon an error
# 8/10/24 will be 3.5.1 - only call hide functions to prevent overlapping images
# 8/10/24 working on double imaging with new ideas from pages 134-135 only call next function once
# 8/9A/24 adding error checking to include WebDriverException for station plots - aborted this idea for now
# 8/9/24 VERSION 3.5.0 random sites and buttons for sites. Check for functional buoys in def check_buoy
# 8/6B/24 brought in option to random choose 3 sites - confusion with variables:
# aobs_site, aobs_url, alternative_town_1, alternative_state_1
# 8/5A/24 ensure duplicate ntl sat labels not produced
# 8/5/24 ensure duplicate lcl radar labels not produced
# 8/2/24 added _forget labels commands to situation of a failed station plots
# 7/31A/24 more code to catch wifi drops for lcl radar
# 7/25/24 more _forget after sarah's display version 3.4.10
# 7/22/24 update ncar radar choose map
# 7/17A/24 further improving NWS radar complete set of frames, order of frames, speed
# 7/17/24 refining clearing disk space
# 7/16/24 working with updated NWS radar
# 7/15/24 removing logging from development machine
# 7/14/24 will include block to _forget labels in show sounding and display baro trace.
# 7/12/24 trying to fix double imaging after inserting NCAR radar
# 7/11A/24 included variable VERSION
# 7/11A/24 inserted code at the end of station center input to test if scraped_frame
# is blank, then call for show_scraped_frame
# for 7/8A/24 working to insert code to free up disk space programmatically
# on 7-8-24 will insert old ucar radar to replace nws radar
# 7/7/24 Attempt to fix radar loop with no echoes
# 7/4/24 need to run legacy version of rp OS 32-bit, x11, not Wayland
