NIST PQC License Summary and Excerpts
=====================================

NIST has entered into two patent license agreements to facilitate adoption of NIST’s announced
selection of Public-Key Encryption PQC algorithm CRYSTALS-KYBER. NIST and the
licensing parties share a desire, in the public interest, the licensed patents be freely available to
be practiced by any implementer of the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm as published by NIST.

The licenses cover a patent portfolio privately owned by a US entity (US Portfolio) [1]_ and a
portfolio controlled by French institutions (French Portfolio) [2]_.

The licenses were drafted such that any implementer of the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm as
published by NIST receive the benefits of a grant to the licensed patents within the scope of a
field of use limited to implementing CRYSTALS-KYBER as a PQC algorithm. The licensors
agreed, on a royalty-free basis, to place into abeyance any right of enforcement of the licensed
patents against any implementer or end-user of the algorithm.

Relevant language (with modifications for readability) from the licenses regarding the scope of
use permitted to implementers of the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm follow. Where language
differs between the licenses in a manner which could be read to influence the rights of
implementers, the language of both licenses is presented.

For the sake of clarity, any implementation or use of the
LICENSED PATENT by LICENSOR, SUBLICENSEE or any of the party that does not meet
the definition of the PQC ALGORITHM, including any modification, extension, or derivation of
the parameters of the PQC ALGORITHM, is not an implementation or use of the PQC
algorithm.
