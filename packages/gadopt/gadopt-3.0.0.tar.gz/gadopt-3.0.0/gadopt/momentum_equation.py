r"""Derived terms and associated equations for the Stokes system.

All terms are considered as if they were on the right-hand side of the equation, leading
to the following UFL expression returned by the `residual` method:

$$
  (dq)/dt = sum "term.residual()"
$$

This sign convention ensures compatibility with Thetis's time integrators. In general,
however, we like to think about the terms as they are on the left-hand side. Therefore,
in the residual methods below, we first sum the terms in the variable `F` as if they
were on the left-hand side, i.e.

$$
  (dq)/dt + F(q) = 0,
$$

and then return `-F`.

Users should not interact with these classes; instead, please use
the solver provided in the stokes_integrators module.
