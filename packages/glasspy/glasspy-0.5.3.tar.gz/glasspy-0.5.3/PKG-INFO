# Welcome to GlassPy
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/197668520.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/197668520)

GlassPy is a Python module for scientists working with glass materials.

## What is it?
GlassPy's current focus is on providing an easy way to load SciGlass data and use GlassNet and ViscNet, two deep learning predictive models of glass and glass-forming liquid properties. Click [here](https://glasspy.readthedocs.io) for the documentation.

## How to install
The source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/drcassar/glasspy.

Binary installers for the latest released version are available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/glasspy/).

Before installing GlassPy, make sure that you have `pytorch` installed (see the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).

To install GlassPy with pip run

```sh
pip install glasspy
```

## Development
GlassPy is under development. API changes are not only likely, but expected as development continues.
