GlassPy documentation
=====================

GlassPy is a Python module for researchers working with `glass materials`_ and
`glass-forming liquids`_. Currently, GlassPy focuses on glass data and
predictive models. GlassPy provides a convenient way to load data from the
`SciGlass database`_ into a Pandas DataFrame. GlassPy is also the home to
GlassNet and ViscNet. GlassNet is a predictive model for many glass properties.
ViscNet is a predictive model for viscosity. GlassPy is still under heavy
development; changes to the API are not only likely, but expected as
development continues.
