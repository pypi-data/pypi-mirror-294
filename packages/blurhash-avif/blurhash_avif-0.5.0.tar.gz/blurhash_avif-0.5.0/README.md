# BlurHash-AVIF

A Python library extending the Python BlurHash implementation to generate BlurHash strings and PNG data URLs for AVIF images.

**Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial extension and has no affiliation with the original BlurHash developers. All credit for the BlurHash concept and implementation goes to its creators.

## Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install blurhash-avif
```

## Features

- Generate BlurHash strings from AVIF images
- Create base64-encoded PNG data URLs from AVIF images
- Maintain image aspect ratio during processing
- Support RGB mode images
- Optimize image loading for improved website performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL) library with AVIF support
- NumPy library
- base64 library
- blurhash library

## Usage

The library provides three main functions:

1. `generate_blurhash_from_avif`: Create a BlurHash string from an AVIF image.
2. `generate_png_data_url_from_avif`: Generate a base64-encoded PNG data URL from an AVIF image.
3. `generate_blurhash_and_data_url_from_avif`: Produce both a BlurHash string and a PNG data URL.

### Example Usage

```python
from blurhash_avif import generate_blurhash_from_avif, generate_png_data_url_from_avif, generate_blurhash_and_data_url_from_avif

# Path to your AVIF file
avif_path = "path/to/your/image.avif"

# Generate BlurHash string
blurhash = generate_blurhash_from_avif(avif_path)
if blurhash:
    print(f"BlurHash: {blurhash}")
else:
    print("Failed to generate BlurHash")

# Generate PNG data URL
data_url = generate_png_data_url_from_avif(avif_path)
if data_url:
    print(f"PNG Data URL: {data_url[:50]}...") # Print first 50 characters
else:
    print("Failed to generate PNG Data URL")

# Generate both BlurHash and PNG data URL
blurhash, data_url = generate_blurhash_and_data_url_from_avif(avif_path)
if blurhash and data_url:
    print(f"BlurHash: {blurhash}")
    print(f"PNG Data URL: {data_url[:50]}...") # Print first 50 characters
else:
    print("Failed to generate BlurHash and PNG Data URL")

```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Pillow's AVIF support, try:

```bash
pip uninstall pillow
pip install "pillow[avif]"
```

you man need to install the `aviflib` library.

To install the required `aviflib` library, follow these steps:

**On macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install libavif
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install libavif-dev
```

**On windows**

```bash
pip install aom
```

or

**On windows (vcpkg)**

```bash
vcpkg install libavif
```
