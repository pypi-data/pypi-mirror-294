====================
collective.tileindex
====================

An add-on for Plone

Features
--------

- Catalog index that tells you which tiles are in use.
  Think of Mosaic or collective.cover, or any package that builds on ``plone.app.blocks``.
- ``tile-types-view`` for a page, showing which tiles this page uses.
- ``tile-types-overview`` for the Plone site root, with a total for the whole site, including search results for individual tiles.
- This has also been made to work with Volto blocks.
  The control panel either shows tiles or blocks, not both.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is this README file.


Translations
------------

This product has been translated into

Installation
------------

Install collective.tileindex by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.tileindex


and then running ``bin/buildout``.
Go to the Add-ons control panel to activate it.
This goes through the whole Plone Site and updates the index for items with the ``plone.layoutaware`` behavior.

Now as Manager you can go to Site Setup, tab Content, then Tile Types Overview to get your overview of tiles or blocks.
