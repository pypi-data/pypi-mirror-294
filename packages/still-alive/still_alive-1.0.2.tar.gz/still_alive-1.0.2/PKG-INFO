# Still Alive

`Still Alive` is a Python package that moves your mouse slightly at regular intervals for a specified period of time. You can set start and end times, or start and end durations to customize the behavior. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your system active by preventing it from going idle.

## Features

- Specify a start and end time (24-hour format) or start and end duration (in minutes).
- Flexible interval control between mouse movements.
- Easily distributable and executable as a command-line tool.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install still-alive
```
