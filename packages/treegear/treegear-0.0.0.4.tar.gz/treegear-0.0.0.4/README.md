**Now this is just for rests to upload and pull the package.**

Version: 0.0.0.4

Usage:
    1. Add a python file (e.g. app.py) with text inside:
        "from treegear import TreeGear

        trgr = TreeGear()

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            quit(0)"
    2. Run it with command: "python -m uvicorn app:trgr"
