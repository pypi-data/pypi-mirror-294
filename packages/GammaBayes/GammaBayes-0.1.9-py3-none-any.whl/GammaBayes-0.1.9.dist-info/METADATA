## Warning

Within the analysis we slice into matrices for the normalisation values of likelihood functions to enforce a normalisation on the interpolation done.
These matrices can be quite large depending on the resolution of the axes chosen. Keep this in mind when implementing multi-processing as python will
duplicate the arrays instead of reference the same one.

## Introduction

This coding repository contains a Bayesian Inference pipeline for calculating dark matter related observables from (simulated) observations from the galactic centre. Example files that run the simulation and analysis can be found within the `docs` folder. All documentation for the code is within the notebook files contained within that folder, that make up the [ReadTheDocs](https://gammabayes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) page and all the major components that make up the analysis in the oncoming publication.

A stable python package version of the code exists on `PyPi` that can be installed with the command,

`pip install gammabayes`.

This will also take care of the required dependencies for the project. 

We recommend to look through the tutorials for an overview of the functionality of the code however, the figure below shows the main classes of `GammaBayes` in a UML diagram.
