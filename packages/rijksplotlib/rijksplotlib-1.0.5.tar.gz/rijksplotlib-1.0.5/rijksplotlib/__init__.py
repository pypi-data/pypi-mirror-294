"""Documentation about rijksplotlib

This module contains the ``rijksplotlib`` package. This package contains a set of
functions and classes that can be used to create plots in a consistent way.
This package tightly integrates with matplotlib and seaborn, and provides
linting-like functionality to ensure that plots are created in a consistent
manner.

The import style of this package is also similar to that of matplotlib and
seaborn. The recommended import style is:

.. code-block:: python

    import rijksplotlib as rpl
    import matplotlib as mpl

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import rijksplotlib.pyplot as rlt

.. warning::

    Although this module mirrors the import structure of ``matplotlib`` we do not fully wrap it.
    If you want to use a function that is not available in ``rijksplotlib``, you can always use the
    ``matplotlib`` module directly.
