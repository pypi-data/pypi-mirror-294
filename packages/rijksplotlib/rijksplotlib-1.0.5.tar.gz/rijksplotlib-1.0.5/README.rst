A datavizualization compliance library for RWS Datalab

The goal of this package is to easily transform your standard `matplotlib` figures (left) to better, recognizable and accessible ones (right).

  :alt: The same screenshot of an RWS report, but with a plot styled using the Rijksplotlib package and helper functions. The figure matches the styling of the document.
  :width: 350px

With just a few lines of code, the text in the figure is aligned with the text in an RWS report and the graph dimensions are optimized. Furthermore, the colors and other styling elements are updated to conform to the Rijkshuisstijl and RWS huisstijl.

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to work on the ``rijksplotlib`` codebase, you'll probably want to install from source.
Or if you simply want to try out the latest features before they are released.
To install rijksplotlib from source, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://gitlab.com/rwsdatalab/public/codebase/tools/rijksplotlib.git
  cd rijksplotlib
  pip install .

Run tests (including coverage) with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install ".[dev]"
  pytest

Documentation and examples can be generated with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install ".[doc]"
  make --directory=doc html # if using Windows use .\doc\make.bat html

.. warning ::

  The documentation dependencies require ``pydantic < 2.0.0``, which is incompatible with the latest version of ``rijksplotlib``.
  Therefore, after installing the documentation dependencies, you need to upgrade ``pydantic`` to the latest 2.x version.

Getting started
---------------

Plot your figure in the way you are used to. Then, use ``rlt.show()`` or ``rlt.savefig`` instead of using ``plt.show()`` or ``plt.savefig()`` to show or save the figure.

.. code-block:: python

    import rijksplotlib.pyplot as rlt

    # plot your graph here #

    rlt.show()
    # or #
    rlt.savefig()


This package helps you optimize your figures for RWS reports. Using the ``rijksplotlib.pyplot.show`` or ``rijksplotlib.pyplot.savefig`` helper functions, it provides feedback when you are missing elements necessary for a good figure. Furthermore, the resulting figure fits precisely within the RWS report preset margins. When you place your figure in a report, the font sizes of all elements are readable and fit in with the rest of the text well.

For more background information on making representative and good figures, see the `Stijlgids Datavisualisatie RWS <https://pleinienw.nl/articles/297813>`_ (intranet).
