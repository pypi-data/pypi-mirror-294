# PsiZ Examples

If you are looking for a place to start, we recomend `rank/mle_1g.py`. This example demonstrates the simplest use case.

The examples are organized into separate directories based on the type of behavioural data collected (i.e., trial type).
* `rank`
* `rate`

Where appropriate, part of the filename indicates the type of inference performed.
* `mle` indicates maximum liklihood inference which yields a point estimate model.
* `vi` indicates variational inference which yields a posterior probability model.
