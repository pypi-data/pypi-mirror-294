This library was created for handling high-resolution images from the Opera Phenix Plus High-Content Screening System, including operations such as concatenating raw series of images, z-projection, channel merging, image resizing, etc. Additionally, we have included options for annotating specific parts of images and selecting them for further analysis, for example, teaching ML/AI algorithms. Certain elements of this tool can be adapted for data analysis and annotation in other imaging systems. For more information, please feel free to contact us!
