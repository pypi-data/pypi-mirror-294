``premise`` is a Python tool for prospective life cycle assessment. 
It allows users to project the ecoinvent 3 database into the future, 
using scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). It does so by 
modifying the ecoinvent database to reflect projected energy policy trajectories, include emerging
technologies, modify market shares as well as technologies' efficiency.

Among others, it can be used to assess the environmental impacts of future energy systems,
and to compare different energy policies. It includes a set of IAM scenarios
and a set of tools to create custom scenarios.

The tool was designed to be user-friendly and to allow for reproducible results. 
While it is built on the [brightway2 framework](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/), 
its outputs can naturally be used in [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser), 
but also in other LCA software, such as SimaPro, OpenLCA, or directly in Python.

The tool is described in the following scientific publication: [Sacchi et al, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112311).
If this tool helps you in your research, please consider citing this publication.


What's new in 2.1.1?
====================

- Ecoinvent 3.10 support
- Adds inventories on ammonia production
- Fixes issues with scaling applied to PV systems

What's new in 2.1.0?
====================

- More efficient use of memory.
- Easier syntax for using custom scenarios.

What's new in 2.0.0?
====================

- Adds .write_db_to_olca(), which produces a slightly modified version of a Simapro CSV database file which can then be imported in OpenLCA. The use of the SimaPro_Import.csv mapping file must be selected.
- Marginal mixes were wrong because the average lifetime of the mix was calculated using the technology-specific lead time values instead of lifetime values.
- Fix issue with CCS implementation in IMAGE scenarios
- Fix several issues with external/custom scenarios linking algorithm.
- Drops DAC efficiency improvement based on cumulated deployment. Uses directly efficiency variables now (if provided).
- Improves documentation for consequential modelling.
- Code-breaking change: update functions are now called like so: .update(xxx). For example, to update the electricity sector: .update(["electricity",]). To update all sectors: .update().
- Changes minimum Python requirement to 3.10

What's new in 1.8.0?
====================

-  Added support for brightway 2.5 (requires `bw2data` >= 4.0.0)
-  Added support for Python 3.11
-  Uses bw2io 0.8.10
-  Adds electricity storage in electricity markets -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html#storage)
-  Adds [scenario explorer dashboard](https://premisedash-6f5a0259c487.herokuapp.com/)

What's new in 1.5.0?
====================

-  Added support for ecoinvent 3.9 and 3.9.1
-  Added support for ecoinvent 3.8 and 3.9/3.9.1 consequential -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/consequential.html)
-  Added REMIND SSP1 and SSP5 scenarios -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#default-iam-scenarios)
-  Updated GAINS emission factors, using GAINS-EU and GAINS-IAM -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html#gains-emission-factors)
-  Added new inventories for DAC and DACCS -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html#direct-air-capture)
-  Added new inventories for EPR and SMR nuclear reactors -- see [EPR inventories](https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-nuclear_EPR.xlsx) and [SMR inventories](https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-nuclear_SMR.xlsx)
-  Made mapping to new IAM models easier -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mapping.html)
-  Better logging of changes made to the ecoinvent database -- see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html#logs)

What's new in 1.3.0?
====================

-   Added support for user-generated scenarios (see [docs](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_scenarios.html) and [notebook](https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/examples/examples%20user-defined%20scenarios.ipynb))
-   Updated REMIND scenarios to REMIND v.3.0



Documentation
-------------
[https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Objective
---------

The objective is to produce life cycle inventories under future energy policies, by modifying the inventory database
ecoinvent 3 to reflect projected energy policy trajectories.

Requirements
------------
* **Python 3.10 or 3.11**
* License for [ecoinvent 3][1]. Please note that the ecoinvent database is not included in this package. Also, read ecoinvent's [GDPR & EULA](https://ecoinvent.org/gdpr-eula/).
* Some IAM output files come with the library and are located by default in the subdirectory "/data/iam_output_files". **If you wish to use
 those files, you need to request (by [email](mailto:romain.sacchi@psi.ch)) an encryption key from the developers**.
 A file path can be specified to fetch IAM output files elsewhere on your computer.
 * [brightway2][2] (optional). If you want to use the results in the Brightway 2 framework 8and Activity Browser), you need `bw2data <4.0.0`. To produce Brightway 2.5-compatible databases, you need `bw2data >=4.0.0`.

How to install this package?
----------------------------

Two options:

From Pypi:

    pip install premise

will install the package and the required dependencies.

A development version with the latest advancements (but with the risks of unseen bugs),
is available from Anaconda Cloud:

    conda install -c conda-forge premise


How to use it?
--------------

The best way is to follow [the examples from the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/examples/examples.ipynb).
