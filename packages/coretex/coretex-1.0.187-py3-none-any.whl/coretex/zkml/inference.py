    """
        Performs inference on the provided onnx model with the provided data and also generates
        a zero knowledge proof if a compiled model and key are passed.
        This can be used to verify that the result was gained by
        combining this specific model and input data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : ndarray
            data which will be directly fed to the model

        Union[np.ndarray, Tuple[np.ndarray, Path]]
