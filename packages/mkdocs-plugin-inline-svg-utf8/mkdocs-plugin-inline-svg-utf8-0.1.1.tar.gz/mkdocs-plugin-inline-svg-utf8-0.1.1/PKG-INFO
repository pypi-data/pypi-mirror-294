Description: # mkdocs-plugin-inline-svg-utf8
        
        Extend the plugin from craig0990 to read UTF-8 encoded files
        
        > Reads SVG images referenced from Markdown and replaces them with the SVG
        > file content
        
        Since the SVG is included as part of the plain-text input to MkDocs, this means
        the default MkDocs search supports searching SVG text, and hyperlinks are also
        fully functional.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install the package with pip:
        
        `pip install mkdocs-plugin-inline-svg-utf8`
        
        Enable the plugin in your mkdocs.yml:
        
        ```
        plugins:
            - search
            - inline-svg-utf8
        ```
        
        > Note: If you have no plugins entry in your config file yet, you'll likely
        > also want to add the search plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is
        > no plugins entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.
