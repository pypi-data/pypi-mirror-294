        ScriptPilot is designed to manage the execution of multiple Python scripts based on their status 
        defined in a text file named 'sp_on_board.txt'. ScriptPilot provides functionalities to start, stop, 
        and monitor these scripts. It ensures that scripts are not duplicated and manages their lifecycle 
        efficiently.
