  /**Definitions of `command`, `cmdOnThRun` and general context about `PyodideConsole`:
   * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   *
   * All those properties, but especially `cmdChunk`, are trickier than they seem.
   * This is essentially because the hidden/inner PyodideConsole is actually running totally
   * independently of the jQuery.terminal object itself.
   *
   * 1. Concretely, the PyodideConsole is handling the code itself without troubles, but anything
   * other than "just run that code" (aka, installations/imports, exclusions, ...) still has to
   * be done around the console.
   *
   * Problems arise when  you need to know on JS/Theme side if the cmdChunk is complete or not,
   * and to do so, you need to send the current @cmdChunk to the PyodideConsole, and that little
   * fucker wile automatically schedule the async execution of any complete cmdChunk as soon as
   * you call `pyconsole.push(chunk)` before you can even know it is complete on JS/Theme side.
   *
   *
   * On top of this, what is a cmdChunk, brain-wise, might sometimes be quite different of what
   * a terminal might actually be sending here as argument:
   *
   * @cmdChunk: This is the string content in the terminal that is passed through _WHEN THE USER
   *           HITS `Enter` (without holding Shift key). This implies commands could concretely
   *           be a lot of different things:
   *                - A single line command, just like you'd expect:
   *                      `a = 45+6`
   *                - A multiline command, potentially with several "commands" in it (two, here):
   *                      ```
   *                      globs = {}
   *                      def func(k):
   *                          return globs.get(k, 42)
   *                      ```
   *                - The CONTINUATION of a multiline command started earlier (here it gets messy):
   *                      Previously:   `>>> """ Starting the multi thing`
   *                      Previously:   `... continue it`
   *                      Now:          `... third line`
   *
   *                      After hitting `Enter`, @cmdChunk will be `"third line"` ONLY.
   *                - Any mix of all these (that last 2, I mean).
   *
   *
   * Now, _IF_ the exclusions are already in place before the PyodideConsole execute the complete
   * command, builtins or imports exclusions are already handled because the console uses the
   * global scope.
   *
   * BUT, methods exclusions have to be checked, and missing packages might need to be installed.
   *
   * Considering the UX, it seems highly questionnable to drop exclusions related errors right in
   * the middle of an incomplete command. Even worse: to start installing a package right in the
   * middle of a multiline command... :roll-eyes:
   *
   *
   * Summarizing:
   *
   * 1. Exclusions (builtins & imports), if any, have to be put in place before the current
   *    `cmdChunk` is passed to the PyodideConsole, even if the current "command" is not complete.
   *
   * 2. Methods exclusions and missing packages installation has to be done only when the "current
   *    command" is complete, so the TerminalRunner must keep track of previously entered cmdChunks
   *    and track properly when it is "fully complete", syntax error, ...
   *    This is where `cmdOnTheRun` enters the game.
   *
   *        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *        TODO: the implementation about imports actually do not match this description... => ??
   *        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * 3. When the `PyodideConsole` announce a complete command:
   *      - It's execution in pyodide is already scheduled, but the result stills need to be run
   *        with an async call.
   *      - Before that, excluded methods and missing packages have to be handled, so pass the
   *        `cmdOnTheRun` content to `runPythonCodeWithOptionsIfNoStdErr`, replacing the code
   *        executor method with an async callback that will actually just  await the result
   *        from the internal `PyodideConsole`.
   *
   *
   * IMPLICATIONS:
   *
   * Because of all this, a lot of operations have to be applied each time the user strikes `Enter`
   * in the terminal, even if the command is not complete yet (since, you cannot know upfront...).
   * This is the reason for env_term and post_term executions, for example.
   *
