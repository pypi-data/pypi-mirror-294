Settings
========

Since this module is kind of wrap for `django-impersonate` you need to update `settings.py` according to README.md of `django-impersonate`

There are three lines that require attention.

```
IMPERSONATE = {
    "URI_EXCLUSIONS": [],
    "REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME": "next",
    "REDIRECT_URL": "/",
}
```
