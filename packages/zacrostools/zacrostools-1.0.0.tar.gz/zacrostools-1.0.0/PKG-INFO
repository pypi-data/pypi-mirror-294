# ZacrosTools

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is under development. The documentation is in preparation.

ZacrosTools is a simple toolkit for the preparation of **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)** input files. It is specially 
useful when running scans at different pressure and temperature conditions, which may require hundreds of KMC 
simulations.

## Installation

The easiest way to install ZacrosTools is by using pip:
```{code-block}
$ pip install zacrostools
```
Alternatively, it can also be cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/hprats/ZacrosTools):
```{code-block}
$ git clone https://github.com/hprats/ZacrosTools.git
```
The only requirements are [scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## How to use it

Please, follow this link for the documentation: https://zacrostools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
