# Jupyter File ID

Jupyter File ID is a server extension that allows for developers to easily track
the path of files under the server root over their lifetimes, even when moved.

Developers use Jupyter File ID by requesting a file ID for the file they wish to
track. They can then resolve this file ID to a file path at any time to query
the current path of that file.
